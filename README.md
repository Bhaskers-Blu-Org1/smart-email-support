# email-support-classifier

Providing customer support in a timely manner is very important to enhance customer experience. Organisations receive communication from their customers through various channels like emails, phone calls, applications etc. Organisations need to understand the intent and content of each of the communication and ask customers for any additional information required to fulfil their requests.

In this code pattern we take telecom domain customer support catering to email requests and we consider scenarios for **Enabling a service**, **disabling a service**, **changing plans** and **Adding family member to a plan**

As a customer support, one should
- Know the intent of emails
- Know information available in these emails
- Identify information that is missing
- Auto-compose responses and send emails

This code pattern provides an automatic and cognitive way of achieving the above requirements. It uses natural language processing of emails, understanding intents of emails, auto composing responses and providing a dashboard with high level summary of intents and emails. While the use case demonstrated here is for a telecom domain, it can be applied to any domain with similar feature requirements. It integrates with database, which acts as a CRM, to pull customer information to validate emails and requests. It uses Watson Knowledge Studio (for custom domain natural language processing), Watson Natural Language Understanding (to deploy custom domain model and get entities from emails), Watson Natural Language Classifier (to get intent of email), Node-RED (integrates with email, watson services and coudant database), CloudantNoSQL database (to store emails and customer data) and Node runtime.

After completing this pattern, you will learn how to:
- Build a custom model using Watson Knowledge Studio and deploy it on Watson Natural Language Understanding
- Build a node-RED flow that integrates email server, watson services (NLU and NLC) and Cloudant database
- Deploy application, send sample customer emails and see the emails being auto processed using a simple UI

- Click `Deploy`. Select `Natural Language Understanding`. Click `Next`. Select appropriate region and space. From the Service name drop down select the NLU instance that was created in section 2.1 <TODO section 2.1 to be link here>. Click `Deploy`.
- When deployed make a note of the model id. Click `OK`.


## 3. Create WKS Cloudant databases
- Create cloudant service instance on IBM Cloud using this [link](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/tutorials/create_service.html#creating-an-ibm-cloudant-instance-on-ibm-cloud)
- Create email database
  - On the left navigation bar of the service instance, click `Manage`. Then click `Launch Cloudant Dashboard`.
  - On the top right side of the screen, click on `Create Database`.
  - Enter the name of the database as *email* and click `Create`.
- Create Customer database
  - On the left navigation bar of the service instance, click `Manage`. Then click `Launch Cloudant Dashboard`.
  - On the top right side of the screen, click on `Create Database`.
  - Enter the name of the database as *customer_data* and click `Create`.
  - Populate customer data by following the below steps
    - In Cloudant dashboard, click on `databases`.
    - Click on `customer_data` database
    - On the right top corner click on `Create Document`.
    - Then add customer data in the following format (Note: Only "\_id", "first_name", "last_name", "email", "phone_no" are mandatory)
    ```
    {
      "_id": "<email id of customer>",
      "first_name": "<first name of customer>",
      "last_name": "<last name of customer>",
      "email": "<email id of customer>",
      "phone_no": "<phone number of customer>",
      "plan": "<plan of customer>",
      "family": [
        {
          "first_name": "<first name of family member, if any>",
          "last_name": "<last name of family member, if any>",
          "phone_no": "<phone number of family member>",
        }
      ],
      "services": [
        "MCA",
        "News"
      ]
    }
    ```
    e.g
    ```
    {
      "_id": "muralidhar.chavan@gmail.com",
      "first_name": "Muralidhar",
      "last_name": "Chavan",
      "email": "muralidhar.chavan@gmail.com",
      "phone_no": "1234567890",
      "plan": "Unlimited"
    }
    ```

    Similarly add other customer details. For the sake of this pattern we have considered four customer records

## 4. Create NLC Instance
- [Create Watson NLC](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-classifier) service
- Select appropriate region, org and space and click `Create`.
- Click `Show Credentials` and copy and save `Username` and `password` somewhere.
- In a command prompt, change directory to <git repo parent folder>/NLC
- Run the below command after updating *NLC Username*
```
curl -i --user "username":"password" -F training_data=@./Intent_training.csv -F training_metadata="{\"language\":\"en\",\"name\":\"NLClassifier\"}" "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers"
```
- The NLC instance will be trained with the training data *Intent_training.csv*. It takes a few minutes to train NLC.
- Get classifier id using the command
```
curl -u "username":"password"  "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/classifiers"
```
- Make a note of "classifier_id"
